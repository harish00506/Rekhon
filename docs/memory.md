<!--
  Why:  A single, cheap-to-update place that says where the project actually is — what's done,
        what's in flight, what's next — so any session (human or agent) can resume without
        re-deriving state from git and 85 issue files.
  What: Living progress tracker for the codebase.
  Result: A reader knows the current version, completed work, the file in progress, and next up.
  Changelog:
    2026-07-18 — Created. Baseline: Epic 0 (blueprint) done; no Kotlin code yet.

# AI Personal CFO — Project Memory

> **Update this on every shipped issue and whenever you switch what you're working on.** Keep it
> short. This is the *project progress* log — distinct from the agent's own memory dir at
> `~/.claude/.../memory/`. Detail lives in [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md) and the per-issue
> trackers in [`issues/`](issues/); the static roadmap is [`phase.md`](phase.md).

## Current state

- **Version:** `0.2.1` (see [`../VERSION`](../VERSION)) · **Phase:** 0 — Foundation (Epic 2 under way).
- **Currently working file:** `feature/onboarding/` — issue 2.1, on branch
  `feature/2-1-4-step-onboarding-flow`, implemented and verified but **not yet committed**.
- **In progress:** **Epic 2 · issue 2.1** — 4-step onboarding
  ([2.1](issues/2.1-4-step-onboarding-flow.md) ·
  [tracker](issues/2.1-4-step-onboarding-flow-tracker.md)).
- **Next up:** **2.2** (biometric/PIN lock) and **2.5** (accounts CRUD) — 2.5 is the first
  `:data:repository` code and the first real schema version bump. 2.3 (quick-setup seeds) can now
  read the figures 2.1 captures. Both 2.2 and 2.5 insert a step into the onboarding flow; where,
  is fixed by [ADR-0002](adr/0002-onboarding-step-order.md).
- **Still the largest gap:** CI has never run — there is no git remote, so every green is a local
  green on one Windows machine.

## Completed

- **Epic 0 — Foundations & AI blueprint (v0.1.0):**
  - AI subsystem files the app loads at runtime ([`../ai/`](../ai/)) — layered pipeline,
    orchestrator, rulebook + order-of-operations, chat tool registry, LLM prompt + guardrail,
    knowledge bases.
  - Agent/dev config: [`../CLAUDE.md`](../CLAUDE.md), project skills, slash commands, CI, PR
    template, ENGINE/ADR templates.
  - Planning layer: [design spec + CSV](superpowers/specs/2026-07-17-ai-personal-cfo-design.md)
    (13 epics, 85 issues) and the full [`issues/`](issues/) backlog + trackers.
  - `/run` and `/verify` commands; `VERSION` + `CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Project docs (this set, 2026-07-18):** `PRD.md`, `Architecture.md`, `Rules.md`, `phase.md`,
  `Design.md`, `memory.md`.
- **Epic 1 — Foundation & Core Platform (v0.1.0, 2026-07-25):** issues 1.1–1.10 — the multi-module
  skeleton and its ARC-002 guard, `Money`/`Clock`/`Result`, five custom lint rules, encrypted Room
  over SQLCipher plus the migration harness, the M3 design system, Proto DataStore settings and the
  consent ledger, and the app shell with a typed nav graph. Full account of what is and is not
  proven: [`handoff_epic_completed/epic-1-foundation-handoff.md`](handoff_epic_completed/epic-1-foundation-handoff.md).
- **Epic 2 — issue 2.1 (v0.2.1, 2026-07-25):** the 4-step first-run onboarding. First screen that
  writes; closes the "nothing sets the profile time zone" seam from Epic 1 and gives the consent
  ledger its first caller.

## How to update

When you finish an issue: bump [`../VERSION`](../VERSION) + [`../CHANGELOG.md`](../CHANGELOG.md),
update the issue's tracker, then edit the three lines under **Current state** above and add a
bullet under **Completed**. That's it.
