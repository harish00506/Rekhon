# Changelog

All notable changes to AI Personal CFO are recorded here.
Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). Versioning: [SemVer](https://semver.org).
Single source of truth for the version number is the repo-root [`VERSION`](VERSION) file; keep
`app/build.gradle.kts` `versionName` equal to it. Epics map to the SRS roadmap (§26); every
entry cites its requirement IDs (§28). See [`docs/issues/00-issue-workflow.md`](docs/issues/00-issue-workflow.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Reference-style backlog** (`docs/superpowers/specs/`): a planning-grade design spec
  (`2026-07-17-ai-personal-cfo-design.md`, 14 §-sections distilling the SRS) and its
  machine-readable index (`2026-07-17-issues.csv`) — **13 epics, 85 issues** mapped to the SRS
  roadmap (§26) and traceability (§28).
- **Full issue backlog** (`docs/issues/`): one rich `<id>-<slug>.md` + `<id>-<slug>-tracker.md`
  per issue (170 files), each with acceptance criteria, a label-driven Skill Rules table, guiding
  principles, three-tier workflow rules, a Definition-of-Done gate, and a Verification-Log tracker.
- **Issue-docs generator** (`scripts/gen_issue_docs.py`): single source of truth holding all 85
  issue records; emits the CSV + every issue/tracker file, idempotently.
- **Reference-format templates**: `_ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md` / `_TRACKER_TEMPLATE.md` rewritten to match
  the generated files.
- **Android use-case dev skills** (19, global `~/.claude/skills/`): `compose-ui`,
  `room-and-migrations`, `hilt-di`, `gradle-modules`, `ml-kit-ocr`, `on-device-llm`,
  `workmanager-jobs`, `datastore-consent`, `keystore-crypto`, `biometric-auth`,
  `retrofit-networking`, `glance-widget`, `paparazzi-screenshot-testing`, `proguard-r8-release`,
  `kotlin-multiplatform`, `compose-navigation`, `compose-performance`, `edge-to-edge`,
  `kotlin-coroutines-flow` — each a project-tailored playbook for the pinned §21.3 stack, citing the
  binding rules (ARC/AI-ARC/MNY/TIM/SEC, P-01…P-08). The last six are grounded in the official
  Google Android (R8 audit, Navigation 3, edge-to-edge, Compose performance / Baseline Profiles) and
  JetBrains/Kotlin (KMP, coroutines/Flow) agent-skill guidance rather than copied from third-party
  registries (skills.sh's mobile catalogue is React-Native/Firebase-centric and its cloud-auth skills
  conflict with P-01/P-04); reconciled line-by-line against those official SKILL.md sources, which
  also surfaced the coroutines/Flow-discipline and Compose-recomposition gaps the last three close.
  Wired into the generator's `LABEL_SKILLS` so each surfaces on the relevant issues — including
  crypto/backup, auth, market-data, integration, widget, designsystem, testing, release, `kmp`,
  `dashboard`/`core`, and the previously-unmapped `app`/`di`/`lint`/`accounts`/`transactions`/
  `notifications` labels. The 7 universal skills (`test-driven-development`, `security-review`,
  `ci-cd-and-automation`, …) were already installed globally — left untouched. `check_issue_docs.py`
  asserts every referenced skill path resolves.
- **`/run` and `/verify` commands** (`.claude/commands/`): the "real gate" (§9) — build + install +
  launch on an emulator, then drive the changed flow (incl. an airplane-mode leg) and confirm it works.
- **Top-level project docs** (`docs/`): `PRD.md`, `Architecture.md`, `Rules.md`, `phase.md`,
  `Design.md`, `memory.md` — thin, cross-referenced views of the SRS / design spec / `CLAUDE.md`
  for fast onboarding (the SRS and `CLAUDE.md` remain the sources of truth). `Design.md` proposes
  the initial Material 3 tokens (seed `#00696E`, Roboto, M3 type scale) pending issue 1.8;
  `memory.md` is the living progress tracker.

### Changed
- **`docs/features/`** repositioned as the deeper **sub-task** layer the issues link down into
  (kept; the 13-epic CSV is now the canonical epic/issue index). `00-issue-workflow.md` and
  `docs/features/README.md` point at the new spec + CSV.

### Removed
- Superseded feature-level `docs/issues/1.1-project-skeleton.md` + tracker (replaced by issues
  1.1–1.5, which link down to the existing `docs/features/1.1-project-skeleton/tasks/` files).

## [0.1.0] — Epic 0: Foundations & AI blueprint  (2026-07-17)

### Added
- **AI subsystem files** the app loads at runtime (`ai/`): layered-pipeline architecture,
  Insight Orchestrator workflow + engine registry, RULE-KB rulebook + Financial Order of
  Operations, chat tool registry, LLM system prompt + numeric guardrail, and the
  classification / market-signal / tax / seasonality / vehicle-maintenance knowledge bases.
  (SRS §7, §8, §19, §29, §30, §36, §38.)
- **Agent development config** for writing & maintaining the code: `CLAUDE.md` (binding rules),
  project skills (`new-engine`, `add-rulebook-rule`, `money-time-audit`), slash-command
  workflows (`/new-feature`, `/pre-merge`), CI pipeline, PR template, `ENGINE.md` + ADR
  templates, `.editorconfig`. (SRS §4.2, §21.)
- **Issue workflow** (`docs/issues/`): master workflow + issue/tracker templates for driving
  backlog issues from the SRS.
- `VERSION` and this changelog.

### Notes
- No application (Kotlin/Gradle) code yet — this release is the spec-faithful scaffolding and
  the AI/agent configuration that the build will be written against.
